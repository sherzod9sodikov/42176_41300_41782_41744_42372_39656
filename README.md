# Virtual Currency Exchange Platform

This project is a full-stack virtual currency exchange platform developed by a team of six students. Users can register, log in, exchange currencies, send money to others, and view their transaction history. The frontend uses real-time exchange rates via an external API, and both frontend and backend are fully tested.

## Project Structure

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

* `controllers/`: Contains business logic (e.g. user registration, transactions)
* `routes/`: Express routers for users, accounts, and transactions
* `models/`: Mongoose schemas for User, Account, Transaction
* `middlewares/`: Auth middleware using JWT
* `tests/`: Unit tests using **Jest** and **Supertest**

### API Overview

* `POST /user/signup`: Register new user
* `POST /user/signin`: Login and receive JWT token
* `GET /account/balance`: Get current balances
* `POST /account/transfer`: Send money to another user
* `POST /account/exchange`: Exchange currencies
* `GET /transaction/history`: View all user transactions
* `GET /transaction/history/:id`: View a specific transaction

---

### Frontend (React)

* `src/pages/`: Contains route pages like SignIn, Dashboard, SendMoney, ExchangePage
* `src/components/`: UI components like DashboardButtons, TransactionHistory
* `src/services/api.js`: Axios instance to handle backend communication
* Uses `react-router-dom` for navigation
* Uses `fetch()` to get real-time exchange rates from [exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/)

---

## Testing

### Backend Testing (Jest + Supertest)

Located in `backend/tests/` folder. Covered:

* ‚úÖ User registration
* ‚úÖ User login
* ‚úÖ Get balance
* ‚úÖ Transfer money
* ‚úÖ Exchange currency
* ‚úÖ Transaction history

Run backend tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Frontend Testing

#### Unit Testing with Jest + React Testing Library

Test file: `src/__tests__/App.test.jsx`

* ‚úÖ Rendering of Sign In, Sign Up, Dashboard pages

Run frontend tests:

```bash
npm test
```

#### End-to-End Testing with Cypress

Test file: `cypress/e2e/flow.cy.js`

Tested user flows:

* ‚úÖ Login
* ‚úÖ Exchange currency
* ‚úÖ Send money
* ‚úÖ View transaction history

Run Cypress:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

## External Services

* üåê **Exchange Rates** ‚Äì Uses [https://exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/#/) for real-time rates.
* üîê **Authentication** ‚Äì Secured using JWT tokens on all protected routes.

## Summary

This app demonstrates full-stack development with a focus on clean architecture, modular codebase, and comprehensive testing. The combination of backend unit tests and frontend UI tests ensures reliability and stability across the whole system.
